Welcome to my AwesomeWM configuration files! My system is managed by Git Subtrees; this github repository is git subtree which is mapped to the [[https://github.com/raven2cz/dotfiles][raven2cz/dotfiles]] project.

AwesomeWM is a highly configurable by LUA, next generation framework window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the ~GNU GPLv2~ license.

It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people dealing with every day computing tasks and who wants to have fine-grained control on their graphical environment.

* Dashboard Component
A dashboard component for AwesomeWM is a collection of wiboxes, which are panels that can be used to display various information and controls. These wiboxes are include:

- A time wibox, which could display the current time in a digital format. This wibox could also include a clock widget, which could be configured to display the time in various formats, switching between minutes and second processing.
- A calendar wibox, which could display a calendar for the current month. This wibox could also include a widget that allows users to navigate to different months and view their schedules (opened topic).
- A controls wibox, which could include buttons or widgets for controlling various aspects of the system, such as volume, brightness, and power.
- A player wibox, which could display the currently playing song and provide controls for playing, pausing, and skipping songs.
- A tasklist wibox, which could display a list of currently running applications and allow users to switch between them, add favourites applications and icons.
- A terminal wibox, which could include a terminal emulator that allows users to interact with the command line and chat-gpt.
- A news wibox, to show actual news. Actual implementation shows just fortune news.
- A collage wibox, beautiful preview of images in defined folder, theme folder, selected folder.
- Right panel wibox for exit control commands.
- And many others.

Each of these wiboxes could be customized with different colors, fonts, and layouts, fully supports *Multicolor Theme Changes*, to create a cohesive and visually pleasing dashboard. Additionally, the dashboard component could also include the ability to toggle the visibility of the some wiboxes. Support for HiDPI resolutions.
